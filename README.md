My teammates and I  have traced the characteristics of people in Georgia that are most likely to be unbanked. 
Then, our objective is to help those people get access to financial services more easily. 
We used the random forest method because we wanted our score to be as accurate as possible.
Our accuracy score was 1, meaning that our model was 100% accurate and able to identify which characteristics were more at risk of being unbanked and which were not.
Our team was investigating the characteristics of the unbanked in Georgia from 2015 to 2019. According to the FDIC website, we found data that showed that 9.8% of 
Georgians within that time period were unbanked, meaning that they did not own a bank account. What we were trying to analyze were the characteristics that depicted
them at risk for not having a bank account and to help close that gap. We found data that depicted several demographics and the likelihood (in percentage) of them not 
having a bank account. We then averaged those percentages and any characteristic that had a percentage over the average, we labeled them as risky characteristics (1) 
and those with percentages less or equal than the average we labeled them as not at risk (0).  Some of the variables we used to characterize individuals included age, 
race, and income. Using these variables we were able to determine the accuracy in which we were able to pinpoint individuals who did not have bank accounts. 
The data from the Federal Deposit Insurance was very helpful. It allowed us to point out the most risky characteristics. To give an insight of our results; we have 
learned that people with less than $15000 a year, people with no high school, Hispanic people , non-homeowner or foreign-born noncitizens are the individuals who are
more likely to be unbanked. Of course, our goal is to help those who want to have access to financial services, but because of numerous circumstances such as lack of 
information are not able to. Nowadays, thanks to the rapid growth of technology, anybody can have access to information. We can improve upon this model by not only 
determining which individuals do not have access to bank accounts, but by also seeing if there is a correlation to why this is the case.  As our goal is to provide
individuals without access to bank accounts to one. In a very fast transition world and the rising of Covid a lot of businesses and establishments have transitioned 
into only accepting cards or taking a lot of forms of online payment. While the usage is convenient to some it is not the most convenient to every individual especially
those without bank accounts.
